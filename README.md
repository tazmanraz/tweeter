# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. I worked on the front end using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX.

- ES5 formatting was consistently used so arrow functions were avoided. This is because I couldn't get one of the jQuery functions working with arrow functions.
- Working on a desktop+ dimensions on media queries. A max width needs to be specified. I can't imagine this page looking pretty on a widescreen TV.
- Need to figure out a way to lock the textbox. Currently users can manipulate the size of it.
- Some minor tweaks and adjustments required to make things look nicer such as: user display header, fonts, nicer looking error messages.
- The stretch components of leading to top of page (should be able to do by referencing local hrefs) and a toggle for the textarea.
