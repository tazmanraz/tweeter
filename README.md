# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. I worked on the front end using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX.

## Dependencies

- body-parser
- chance
- express
- md5
- Node 5.10.x or above

## Getting Started

- Install all dependencies (using the `npm install` command).
- Run the development web server using the `npm run` command to start the server.
- Interact with Tweeter by going to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser.

## Notes

- ES5 formatting was consistently used so arrow functions were avoided. This is because I couldn't get one of the jQuery functions working with arrow functions.
- Figuring out a desktop+ dimensions on media queries. A max width needs to be specified. I can't imagine this page looking pretty on a widescreen TV.
- The stretch components of linking to top of page (should be able to do by referencing local hrefs) and a toggle for the textarea need to be worked on still.
